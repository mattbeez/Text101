You wake up to the sound of an alarm.  You are lying in a cryo-sleep chamber.  It was supposed to keep you under until the ship reached it's destination.  Something is wrong.
What do you do?

1.  Hit the emergency release button on the inside of the chamber.
2.  Go back to sleep.  Everything will smooth over on it's own.
