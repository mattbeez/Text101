  storyText: "You tell the computer to repair the affected area.  The computer initiates
    the nano-bot repair procedure.  It gets to 20% before it fails.  \"Damage critical. 
    Nano-bot repair unsuccessful,\" the computer voice states.  \n\nYou panic and
    run down the hall to the escape pods.  As you round the corner to the escape
    pod, you feel your breathing getting heavier and your vision getting spotty. 
    You collapse to the ground, unable to breathe.  Your vision fades to black as
    you hear the ship caving in on itself.\n\nThat wasn't the right way to go.  Do
    you want to try again?\n\n1.  Yes, I'll learn from my mistakes.\n2.  No, I'm
    done with space.\n\n"
