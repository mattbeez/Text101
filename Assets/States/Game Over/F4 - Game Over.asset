  storyText: 'You perform a full system check.  "OXYGEN SYSTEM CRITICAL" flashes
    across the screen.  You can see that the ship has suffered hull damage.  You
    start to feel light headed.


    You drop down from the chair and start to pull
    yourself down the hall towards the escape pods.  As you get closer, your vision
    gets darker and darker.  You can hear the groan of metal as the ship starts to
    cave in on itself.  You lose consciousness before the ship tears itself apart.

    wasn''t the right way to go.  Do you want to try again?


    1.  Yes, I''ll
    learn from my mistakes.

    2.  No, I''m done with space.
