  storyText: "You sprint down the corridor towards the escape pods.  As you make
    your way down the hall, you feel your vision begin to get spotty.  \n\nYou find

    breath your last breath of air.  \n\nThat wasn't the right way to go.  Do you
    want to try again?\n\n1.  Yes, I'll learn from my mistakes.\n2.  No, I'm done
    with space."
