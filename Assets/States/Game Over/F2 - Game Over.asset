  storyText: 'You perform a lifeform scan on the garbage disposal sector.  The computer
    runs multiple checks and indicates that the area is clear.  This should have
    been obvious as everyone is cryo-sleep.


    As you go to seal off the damaged
    area of the ship, you hear a loud metallic groaning noise.  The connected areas
    to the garbage disposal start to flash red.


    You feel your vision start
    to fade as the oxygen depletes from the room and you fall to the floor.


    That
    wasn''t the right way to go.  Do you want to try again?


    1.  Yes, I''ll
    learn from my mistakes.

    2.  No, I''m done with space.'
