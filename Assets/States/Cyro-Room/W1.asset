  storyText: "You seal off the garbage disposal from the rest of the ship.  The computer
    prompts you to detach the affected area from the ship before any other sections
    are damaged.\n\nYou confirm the operation and the sector is jettisoned away from
    the ship.  The alarm turns off and the ship returns to it's usual quiet hum. 
    \n\nYou crawl back into your cryo-chamber and close the lid.  The chamber pressurizes
    and you fade off back to sleep.\n\nCongratulations!  You saved the day!  Do you
    want to play again?\n\n1.  Yes, I want to try again.\n2.  No, I'm done with space."
