  storyText: 'You seal off the affected section of the ship and the alarm stops. 
    The screen indicates that all systems are optimal.  You prompt the computer to
    detach the affected area from the rest of the ship.


    Once you are sure everything
    is good, you crawl back into your pod, the lid closes, the chamber pressurizes
    and you fade off back to sleep.


    Congratulations!  You saved the day!  Do
    you want to play again?


    1.  Yes, I want to try again.

    2.  No, I''m
    done with space.'
